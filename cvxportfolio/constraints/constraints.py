    :param factor_exposure: Series or DataFrame giving the factor exposure.
        All elements must be non-negative.
        If Series it is indexed by assets' names and represents factor
        exposures constant in time. If DataFrame it is indexed by time
        and has the assets names as columns, and it represents factor
        exposures that change in time. In the latter case an observation
        must be present for every point in time of a backtest.
        If you want you can also pass multiple factor exposures at once:
        as a dataframe indexed by assets' names and whose columns are the
        factors (if constant in time), or a dataframe with multiindex:
        first level is time, second level are assets' names (if changing
