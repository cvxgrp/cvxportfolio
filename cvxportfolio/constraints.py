"""Here we define many realistic constraints that apply to :ref:`portfolio
optimization trading policies <optimization-policies-page>`.

Some of them, like :class:`LongOnly`, are
very simple to use. Some others are more advanced,
for example :class:`FactorNeutral`
takes time-varying factor exposures as parameters.

For a minimal example we present the classic Markowitz allocation.

.. code-block:: python

    import cvxportfolio as cvx

    objective = cvx.ReturnsForecast() - gamma_risk * cvx.FullCovariance()

    # the policy takes a list of constraint instances
    constraints = [cvx.LongOnly(applies_to_cash=True)]

    policy = cvx.SinglePeriodOptimization(objective, constraints)
    print(cvx.MarketSimulator(universe).backtest(policy))

With this, we require that the optimal post-trade weights
found by the single-period optimization policy are non-negative.
In our formulation the full portfolio weights vector (which includes
the cash account) sums to one,
see equation :math:`(4.9)` at page 43 of
`the book <https://stanford.edu/~boyd/papers/pdf/cvx_portfolio.pdf>`_.
