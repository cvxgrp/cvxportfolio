r"""This module implements the simple forecasting models used by Cvxportfolio.

These are standard ones like historical mean, variance, and covariance. In
most cases the models implemented here are equivalent to the relevant Pandas
DataFrame methods, including (most importantly) the logic used to skip over any
``np.nan``. There are some subtle differences explained below.

Our forecasters are optimized to be evaluated sequentially in time: at each
point in time in a back-test the forecast computed at the previous time step
is updated with the most recent observation. This is in some cases (e.g.,
covariances) much more efficient than computing from scratch.

Most of our forecasters implement both a rolling window and exponential moving
average logic. These are specified by the ``rolling`` and ``half_life``
parameters respectively, which are either Pandas Timedeltas or ``np.inf``.
The latter is the default, and means that the whole past is used, with no
exponential smoothing. Note that it's possible to use both, *e.g.*,
estimate covariance matrices ignoring past returns older than 5 years and
smoothing the recent ones using an exponential kernel with half-life of 1 year.

Finally, we note that the covariance, variance and standard deviation
forecasters implement the ``kelly`` parameter, which is True by default.
This is a simple trick explained in
:paper:`section 4.2 (page 28) <section.4.2>` of the paper, simplifies the
computation and provides in general (slightly) higher performance.
For example, using the notation of the paper, the classical definition of
covariance is

.. math::

    \Sigma = \mathbf{E}(r_t - \mu)(r_t - \mu)^T,

this is what you get by setting ``kelly=False``. The default, ``kelly=True``,
gives instead

.. math::

    \Sigma^\text{kelly} = \mathbf{E}r_t r_t^T = \Sigma + \mu \mu^T,

so that the resulting Markowitz-style optimization problem corresponds to
the second order Taylor approximation of a (risk-constrained) Kelly objective,
as is explained briefly :paper:`at page 28 of the paper <section.4.2>`, or with
more detail (and hard-to-read math) in `section 6 of the Risk-Constrained Kelly
Gambling paper
<https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/papers/pdf/kelly.pdf#section.6>`_.

Lastly, some forecasters implement a basic caching mechanism.
This is used in two ways. First, online (e.g., in back-test): if multiple
copies of the same forecaster need access to the estimated value, as is the
case in :class:`cvxportfolio.MultiPeriodOptimization` policies, the expensive
evaluation is only done once. Then, offline, provided that the
:class:`cvxportfolio.data.MarketData` server used implements the
:meth:`cvxportfolio.data.MarketData.partial_universe_signature` method
(so that we can certify which market data the cached values are computed on).
This type of caching simply saves on disk the forecasted values, and makes it
available automatically next time the user runs a back-test on the same market
data (and same universe). This is especially useful when doing hyper-parameter
optimization, so that expensive computations like evaluating large covariance
matrices are only done once.

How to use them
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These forecasters are each the default option of some Cvxportfolio optimization
term, for example :class:`HistoricalMeanReturn` is the default used by
:class:`cvxportfolio.ReturnsForecast`. In this way each is used with its
default options. If you want to change the options you can simply pass
the relevant forecaster class, instantiated with the options of your choice,
to the Cvxportfolio object. For example

.. code-block::

    import cvxportfolio as cvx
    from cvxportfolio.forecast import HistoricalMeanReturn
    import pandas as pd

    returns_forecast = cvx.ReturnsForecast(
        r_hat = HistoricalMeanReturn(
            half_life=pd.Timedelta(days=365),
            rolling=pd.Timedelta(days=365*5)))

if you want to apply exponential smoothing to the mean returns forecaster with
half-life of 1 year, and skip over all observations older than 5 years. Both
are relative to each point in time at which the policy is evaluated.
