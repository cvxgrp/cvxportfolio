Legacy examples from the paper
==============================

*Work in progress.*

These are the examples that were originally developed for the paper. They were
used to generate plots and results in :paper:`chapter 7 <chapter.7>`. They were
developed as IPython notebook, and are being translated into Python code using
the stable API. They are shown for historical reason, but are only partially,
or un-, supported.

The original notebooks are `available on this branch of the repository
<https://github.com/cvxgrp/cvxportfolio/blob/0.0.X/examples/>`_.

.. note::

   For most of them, the translation into Python code and stable API is *work
   in progress*. It might never be done. They have various issues, and for
   some of those perhaps there is no fix.
