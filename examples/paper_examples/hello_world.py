"""This is a simple example of back-tests with Cvxportfolio.

This is a close translation of what was done in `this notebook
<https://github.com/cvxgrp/cvxportfolio/blob/0.0.X/examples/HelloWorld.ipynb>`_.
In fact, you can see that the results are identical.

The approach used here is not recommended; in particular we download
data externally (it is done better now by the automatic data download
and cleaning code we include in Cvxportfolio). The returns used here
are close-to-close total returns, while our interface computes correctly
the open-to-open total returns.

In this example returns and covariances are forecasted externally,
while today this can be done automatically using the default forecasters
used by :class:`cvxportfolio.ReturnsForecast` and
:class:`cvxportfolio.FullCovariance`.

Nevertheless, you can see by running this that we are still able to
reproduce exactly the behavior of the early development versions
of the library.

.. note::

    To run this, you need to install ``yfinance`` and
    ``pandas_datareader``.
