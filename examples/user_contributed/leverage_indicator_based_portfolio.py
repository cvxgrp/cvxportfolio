"""
This example demonstrates how to use cvxportfolio to backtest a portfolio that adjusts its leverage based on a forecast indicator.

The policy implemented in this example uses a forecast indicator to determine the target leverage. If the indicator suggests
increased market risk, the policy reduces the leverage. Conversely, if the indicator suggests a favorable market, it increases
the leverage.

The example includes a custom cost model (StressModel) similar to the one in leverage_margin_portfolio_bid_ask_modelling.py.
