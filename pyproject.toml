# Note on dependencies (lack of) pinning. We are testing in Github CI against
# various combinations of dependency versions, back to versions that were
# current in ~2021. Most probably older ones work too, if they install.
# If we aren't able to test some old dependency it's in most cases because we
# aren't able to install them from wheel or source, since that code tends to
# break more easily over time, especially across different platforms. Important
# dependencies are only Pandas and Cvxpy, and we're not using any particularly
# new feature nor any part of their APIs that is not very well documented. Of
# course if you try very old versions, like before 1.0, things may break. We
# recommend to users to either install Cvxportfolio in a fresh environment,
# with recent versions of the dependencies, or, if they install in a
# pre-existing environment, to run `python -m cvxportfolio.tests` to check that
# their versions of dependencies work correctly. Please do report bugs coming
# from some combination of dependency versions that break Cvxportfolio code.
